# mapping_university_ranking

This repository contains code to map where the top universities are around the world. Specifically:

The script university_mapping.R produces 1. a World view map with the location of the top 5 universities, and 2. a World view map of the top 5 Computer Science departments.

The script top_African_unis.R extracts and shows as a table the top 15 ranked universities in Africa.

You can find a discussion on my blog based on these universtiy results, especially the performance of African universities in world rankings -> link
